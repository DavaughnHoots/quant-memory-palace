# Search Visualization Fix Summary

## Problem
- Search was finding documents but not visualizing them
- "energ" returned 10 results, showed 2 visually
- "energy" returned 2 results, showed none visually

## Root Cause
The `/api/documents` endpoint was timing out when fetching more than a few documents due to:
1. Fetching all document vectors (high-dimensional embeddings)
2. Running PCA calculation on large datasets
3. Calculating clusters for all documents

This meant `documentMeshes` Map was empty, so `highlightDocuments()` couldn't find any meshes to show/hide.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Lightweight Endpoint
- Added `/api/documents/simple` endpoint that:
  - Fetches documents WITHOUT vectors (much faster)
  - Assigns random positions temporarily
  - Skips expensive PCA calculations
  - Returns documents quickly for visualization

### 2. Updated Frontend Loading Strategy
- Modified `loadDocuments()` to use simple endpoint for large datasets (>50 docs)
- Added fallback mechanisms for failed loads
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 3. API Client Enhancement
- `API.getDocuments()` automatically uses simple endpoint for limit > 50
- Maintains compatibility with existing code

## Results
✅ Documents now load successfully (tested with 100+ documents)
✅ Search results properly highlight matching documents
✅ Non-matching documents are hidden during search
✅ Performance is significantly improved

## Testing
```bash
# Test simple endpoint
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/documents/simple?limit=100"

# Test search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "energy", "limit": 5, "threshold": 0.3}'
```

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Implement proper 3D positioning calculation in background
2. Cache calculated positions in Qdrant metadata
3. Use web workers for PCA calculation to avoid blocking
4. Implement progressive loading for very large datasets
